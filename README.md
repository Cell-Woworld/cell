這是一個透過圖形化程式語言(SCXML)進行軟體設計的開發平台。您可以透過這個開發平台，經由繪製SCXML圖形，再加上少許的Javascript，便能完成一整組Android App、iOS App、後台網頁，以及服務大量人數的應用程式伺服器(Application Server)。

This is a development framework for software design through graphical programming language (SCXML, State Chart Diagram).
You can use this framework to "DRAW" your code in SCXML. With a little additional Javascript, you can complete a whole set of Android App, iOS App, backend web pages, and an application server that serve a large number of people.

Supported OS: Windows/Linux/Mac/Android/iOS
