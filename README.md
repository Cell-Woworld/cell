這是一個透過圖形化程式語言(SCXML)進行軟體設計的開發平台。您可以透過這個開發平台，透過繪製SCXML圖形，再加上少許的Javascript，便能完成一整組Android App、iOS App、後台網頁，以及服務大量人數的伺服器。

This is a development framework for software design through graphical programming language (SCXML, State Chart Diagram).
You can use this framework to "DRAW" a programming language in SCXML. With a little additional Javascript, you can complete a whole set of Android App, iOS App, backend web pages, and a server that serve a large number of people.

Supported OS: Windows/Linux/Mac/Android/iOS

Compiler
Visual Studio 2019
g++ 11.1.0
clang++ 5.0.1

Dependencies:
1. ThreadPool: https://github.com/Fdhvdu/ThreadPool

Why to release this framework?
This is my dream that everybody can "DRAW" programming languages to develop any products in the future. 

Thank you for your time and may you have a good day.
